# RecapAutomator
This is a script designed to auto-fill a document for students at a tutoring company. It is supposed to find keywords in the document related to weekly assignments, strategy document review, and a general recap text and replace these with paragraph-length responses drawn from a Google Sheet. In addition, the script updates a sheet for each student (created externally) that tracks which tests have been assigned and which tests are left empty.
